\note{
NA values in the value field indicate that the data was omitted
or suppressed. We kept these NA values as-is to reflect the
original data from the source.
For temporal comparison, province names in adm1 field are
standardized to the common names with no suffix in metropolitan cities
and "-do" suffix in provinces.
For example, "Seoul" instead of "Seoul Metropolitan City",
and "Jeollabuk-do" instead of "Jeonbuk State".
"KRW" in the unit field stands for South Korean Won.
Values are as-is unless otherwise noted in the unit field
(e.g., "per 100k population" or "million KRW").
